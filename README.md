<h1 align="center">Hello, world!</h1>

I'm **Thony**, a Web Developer, who loves reading and research, and I'm planning to become a full-throttle Front End Developer.

I find it fascinating how software is evolving today and my goal is to learn and use as much as I can. I am currently learning React and Sass, to build up my portfolio. 

I'm also using OpenAI's chat, and Bing Chat to learn and practice, and of course test wacky stuff. I love using <a href="https://meadow-share-aed.notion.site/Team-Space-Home-d6dacefcfbb64026aa5111d4c45ff53a" target="_blank">Notion</a> to document things, write about and leave my thoughts on the go.

## About me
- 🤝 I’m always looking to help! Any opportunity is good to keep learning things.
- 📣 You can ask me about language learning: I speak Spanish (it's my native tongue) and I am fluent in English.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My friends and most people close to me call me "Tiger" as Thony the Tiger 🐯🥣.
- 😽 I'm a cat lover.
