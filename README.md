<h1 align="center">Hello, world!</h1>

<p>I'm Thony, a Web Development enthusiast, who loves reading and research and is planning to become a full-throttle Front End Developer.</p>

<p>I find fascinating how software is evolving today and my goal is to learn and use as much as I can. I am currently learning React and Sass, to build up my portfolio. I'm also using OpenAI's chat to learn and practice, and of course test wacky stuff. I love using ##Notion to document and to leave my thoughts on the go.</>

<ul>
  <li>🤝 I’m always looking to help! Any opportunity is good to keep learning things.</li>
  <li>📣 You can ask me about language learning: I speak Spanish (it's my native tongue) and I am fluent in English.</li>
  <li>⚡ Fun fact: My friends and most people close to me call me "Tiger" as Thony the Tiger 🐯🥣</li>
</ul>
